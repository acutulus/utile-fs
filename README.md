A temporary holding space for fs-extra, fs.extra, wrench, and utile until we figure out how to merge them together.

Included methods:

  * rimraf
  * mkdirp
  * walk
  * copy (recursive)
  * delete (recursive)
  * remove (recursive)
  * exists (shim)

Some of these are duplicated, we'll figure it out eventually.
